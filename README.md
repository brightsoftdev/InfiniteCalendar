# TUCalendarView

Just because tomorrow is the first day of June doesn't mean you don't care about tomorrow's events or want to see what is happening a week from now. The `TUCalendarView` allows you to see the calendar in a continuous scrolling view so you never lose your context.

`TUCalendarView` is a subclass of `UIScrollView` that displays a month based calendar that scrolls indefinately in either direction.
